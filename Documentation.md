  1. **Computer Vision**
       
        Computer vision is an interdisciplinary scientific field that deals with how computers can be made to gain high-level understanding from digital images or videos. From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to automate tasks that the human visual system can do.[more info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision)

  2. **OpenCV**

      OpenCV (Open source computer vision) is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision.[1] Originally developed by Intel, it was later supported by Willow Garage then Itseez (which was later acquired by Intel[2]). The library is cross-platform and free for use under the open-source BSD license.The library has more than 2500 optimized algorithms. These algorithms can be used to detect and recognize faces, stitch images together to produce a high resolution image of an entire scene,etc.[learn more](https://youtu.be/kdLM6AOd2vc)

**Resources Learnt**

  1. **Git and Github**
   
     Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.[![Git detailed knowledge](http://img.youtube.com/vi/NR_A2gCxaLE/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR_A2gCxaLE "watchvideo")



 2. **MarkDown Format**

     Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text-formatting syntax. Its design allows it to be converted to many output formats, but the original tool by the same name only supports HTML.
